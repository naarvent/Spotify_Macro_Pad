# Spotify Macro Pad

A simple yet powerful Macro Pad for controlling Spotify Desktop using customizable keyboard shortcuts.  
Built in Python with `spotipy` and `pynput`, this script allows you to control playback, volume, track selection, and randomization‚Äîall with physical keys.


## üéØ Features

- üîä Volume up/down in steps of 20%
- ‚èØÔ∏è Play/pause toggle
- ‚èÆÔ∏è Previous and ‚è≠Ô∏è next track navigation
- üîÄ Enable or disable random track selection from a playlist
- üñ±Ô∏è Full keyboard interaction using the following keys by default:
  - `‚Üë` Increase volume
  - `‚Üì` Decrease volume
  - `‚Üê` Play previous track
  - `‚Üí` Play next (or random) track
  - `PgDown` Play/pause
  - `PgUp` Toggle Macro Pad on/off
  - `Del` Toggle shuffle mode

> üí° Press `PgUp` to enable the Macro Pad. The keys will only respond when it is activated.

üß© This Macro Pad is optimized for 60% keyboards, since it maps keys like arrows, Page Up, Page Down, and Delete‚Äîoften easily accessible on that layout.
You can modify the key bindings by editing the on_press function and changing the key names. Each key is detected using keyboard.Key, and the logic is fully customizable.


## üì¶ Requirements

Install the required Python libraries:

    pip install pynput spotipy requests


## üöÄ How to Use

1. Make sure the **Spotify Desktop App** is running and **a track is actively playing**.
2. Set your own Spotify credentials in the script:
   ```python
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET = 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
   SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI = 'http://localhost:8889/callback/'
   PLAYLIST_ID = 'YOUR_PLAYLIST_ID'
   
3. Replace DEVICE_ID with your own playback device (see below).
4. Run the script:
   
       python macro_pad.py


## üîß How to Get Your Spotify Device ID

from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyOAuth
import spotipy

sp = spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyOAuth(
    client_id='YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    client_secret='YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
    redirect_uri='http://localhost:8889/callback/',
    scope="user-library-read user-read-playback-state user-modify-playback-state"
))

devices = sp.devices()
for device in devices['devices']:
    print(f"Device Name: {device['name']}, Device ID: {device['id']}")


## üìù Logging
Every action (play, pause, shuffle toggle, etc.) is written to a log file with timestamps for debugging and tracking purposes.
The log is stored in a dedicated project folder for safety (see below).


## üìÅ File Structure and Safety
All generated files such as .cache (for Spotify token storage) and the log file are stored inside a safe directory:
    Documents/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ naarvent's projects/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SpotifyMacroPad/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .cache
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ macro_pad_log.txt
This prevents interference with other Spotify-based tools or projects you may be using. The folder is created automatically on first run.


## üñ•Ô∏è Optional: Run on Windows Startup

1. Convert the script to .exe with PyInstaller:
   
    pip install pyinstaller
    pyinstaller --onefile macro_pad.py

2. Press Win + R, type:
   
   shell:startup

3. Place a shortcut to the .exe file inside the folder that opens.


## üõ† Customization

You can change the key bindings in the on_press function. For example:

    if key == keyboard.Key.f1:
        toggle_playback()

You can also modify the volume step size, playlist logic, shuffle behavior, or integrate with your own playlist management system.
